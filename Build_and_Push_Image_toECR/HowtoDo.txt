How to Push Docker Image to AWS ECR:

1. First set up AWS CLI in our system, to check aws cli is present or not run this: aws cli
If this shows any output then it means cli is present on the system
2. To set up local user in AWS CLI:
Go to IAM Section and create user with full permission of ECR service and then give programmatic access permission to that user and generate access key and secret access key from there.
3. If you already have old access key in your system and you want to use new one then you need to change it by going to ~/aws/credentials file and edit this credentials file with new access keys.
4. then enter aws configure and write things what the prompt is demanding
5. To create a repo on AWS ECR then write this command:
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name <repo_name> --region <region_name>
6. For Docker to push the image to ECR, first we have to authenticate our Docker credentials with AWS. We use the get-login-password command that retrieves and displays an authentication token using the GetAuthorizationToken API that we can use to authenticate to an Amazon ECR registry.
Use this command:
aws ecr get-login-password --region <region_name>
7. Run this command:
aws ecr --region <region> | docker login -u AWS -p <encrypted_token> <repo_uri>
use same region where your repo is created
8. Run this:
docker tag <source_image_tag> <target_ecr_repo_uri>
9. Pushing the Image:
docker push <ecr-repo-uri>
10. All Done!!
